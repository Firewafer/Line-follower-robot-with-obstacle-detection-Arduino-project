<h1>Line Follower Robot with Obstacle Detection</h1>
<h3 data-sourcepos="3:1-3:20"><strong>Project Overview</strong></h3>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:250">This project showcases the development of a line-following robot with obstacle detection capabilities using the Arduino UNO R3. The robot is designed to autonomously follow a black line on a white surface and halt when it detects any obstacles in its path. This project combines fundamental robotics concepts with practical applications of sensors and microcontrollers.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:19"><strong>Components Used</strong></p>
<ul data-sourcepos="9:1-10:43">
<li data-sourcepos="9:1-9:132">Arduino UNO R3 Microcontroller: The brain of the robot, responsible for processing inputs from sensors and controlling the motors.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="10:1-10:43">L298N Motor Driver: A dual H-bridge motor driver that controls the speed and direction of the DC motors.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="11:1-11:48">DC Motors: Provide the movement for the robot.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="12:1-12:123">9V Battery (or equivalent power source): Powers the entire system. Consider a rechargeable battery pack for extended use.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="13:1-13:109">HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects obstacles in the path of the robot by measuring the distance to objects.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="14:1-15:0">5 Array IR Sensor: Senses the black line on the white surface to guide the robot's movement (quantity can be adjusted based on desired line detection accuracy).</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="16:1-16:17"><strong>Functionality</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="18:1-18:70">The robot follows a black line on a white surface using the 5 Array IR Sensor. The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor continuously scans for obstacles. Upon detecting an obstacle, the robot stops to avoid a collision.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="22:1-22:16"><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<ul data-sourcepos="24:1-26:0">
<li data-sourcepos="24:1-24:244"><strong>Line Following:</strong> The 5 Array IR Sensor detects the black line and sends signals to the Arduino UNO R3. The microcontroller processes these signals and adjusts the motor speeds via the L298N Motor Driver to ensure the robot stays on course.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="25:1-26:0"><strong>Obstacle Detection:</strong> The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time it takes for the echoes to return. If an obstacle is detected within a predefined distance, the Arduino UNO R3 commands the motors to stop, halting the robot.</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:16"><strong>Applications</strong></p>
<ul data-sourcepos="29:1-32:0">
<li data-sourcepos="29:1-29:64">Educational tool for learning robotics and sensor integration.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="30:1-30:43">Base for more complex autonomous systems.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="31:1-32:0">Entry-level project for enthusiasts in robotics and electronics.</li>
